<p>Hi, my name is Anne Henry and I am a junior student at Lehigh University. I am currently a double-major studying Political Science and Journalism. Additionally, I double-minor in Sociology/Anthropolgy and Marketing. This is my online portfolio that I created as a part of my Data Visualization course that is a part of the Journalism curriculum. In this course I have learned to use various visualization creating tools such as Chartbuilder, Tableau, Fusion Maps and more. Displayed here are some examples of my published data visualizations; I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the semester, I have been taking a class in Data Visualization. I have since mastered many techniques that have allowed me to visually display information.</p>
